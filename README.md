# Plant Electrical Signal - Reaction to Sound Analysis

Plants are able to sense sound or sound vibrations. In this repository, useful functions for setting up experiments and analyzing the results are provided.

This repository was set up as documentation for the master thesis 'Can plants sense sound? An evaluation of sensorial abilities of the Codariocalyx motorius' at the University of Cologne.
